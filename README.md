# CapstoneProject_ImproveDonationRate

This is based on the BAIS Capstone Project in Spring 2017 at the Univ. of Iowa.

The project focused on the way to improve the Phonathon program of Ruffalo Noel
Levitz (RNL), especially by increasing the possibility of donation. RNL had 
given random phone calls to alumni and people associated with three target 
universities in the program to raise the donation; but increasing Phonathon 
cost had been an issue, due to low successful donation rates. My group (RNL 
Team 1, Group 6) conducted business analysis based on the given dataset 
including the brief demographic/socioeconomic information about people had been
called and the contents of calls, and provided our conclusions with suggestions
on tactical stretegies.

## Objective
- Perform data analysis to determine what characteristics of clients are 
associated with whether they would donate, based on the provided dataset
- Build a prediction model to forecast what kind of future clients have higher
chances to donate
- Provide suggestions and actions to increase donation rates

## Action Plan/Approach
1. Define the business issues RNL currently has
2. Explore, clean, and analyze dataset
3. Examine the correlation between different variables and donation
4. Test several possible prediction models and figure out the best model
5. Recommend actions to the client to increase their chance of calling a 
potential donor

## Outcomes (Measures of Success)
1. Be able to predict a potential donor
2. Minimize the error rate in our model of predicting donors
3. Figure out which individuals should be flagged as a potential "major donor"

## Tech/Tools Used
- Tools: Mostly R (for some visualizations, Tableau)
- Models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM
